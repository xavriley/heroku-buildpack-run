# Heroku Buildpack: Run

Run custom commands during the build process.


## Description

This buildpack allows to execute arbitrary commands on the build dyno during the build process by running one or more user-supplied Bash scripts.


## Basic Usage

Add the buildpack to your app:

~~~bash
heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/parcelconnect/heroku-buildpack-run
~~~

`--index 1` means that this buildpack is run before any others. Buildpacks are order dependent and the last buildpack in the list is the one which gets to run the process command defined in the `Procfile`.

Create the file `buildpack-run.sh` in the root directory of your app. For example:

~~~bash
# This is buildpack-run.sh
echo "Hello World"
~~~

Now push your app to Heroku as usual. The `buildpack-run.sh` script will be run by Bash during the build.

Note that it is **not** required to add a `#!/bin/bash` to your script (but if it's there, it doesn't do any harm).

## Usage with Another Filename

If you want to use a script with a different name than `buildpack-run.sh`, then you can specify this file in the Heroku app config variable `BUILDPACK_RUN`.

For example, if your script is called `script.sh`:

~~~bash
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_RUN=script.sh
~~~

The specified value must be a filename relative to the root directory of your app, so it could also be something like `bin/script.sh` or `./script.sh`.

Note that the `BUILDPACK_RUN` config variable takes precedence over the default `buildpack-run.sh` file. So, if you have both, a `BUILDPACK_RUN` variable and a `buildpack-run.sh` file, then only the file in `BUILDPACK_RUN` will be executed.

## Usage with Multiple Files

You can specify multiple files in `BUILDPACK_RUN` by separating them with colons:

~~~bash
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_RUN=script1.sh:script2.sh:script3.sh
~~~

The scripts will be executed sequentially in the specified order.

## Usage with Arguments

You can specify arguments to your scripts, just as you would on the command line.

For, example, you can do something like this:

~~~bash
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_RUN="script1.sh 1 2 3:script2.sh hey 'hello world'"
~~~

And this will execute `bash script1.sh 1 2 3` and then `bash script2.sh hey 'hello world'`.

## Build Environment Variables

The following variables holding information about the Heroku build environment are accessible to your scripts:

- `BUILD_DIR`: absolute path of your app's root directory on the build dyno
- `CACHE_DIR`: directory on the build dyno that persists between builds
- `ENV_DIR`: directory containing files for the app's Heroku config variables

The working directory for your scripts is `BUILD_DIR`, which is the root directory of your app.
